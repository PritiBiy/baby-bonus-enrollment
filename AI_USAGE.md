# AI Usage

This document describes how AI tools were used during the development of this service.

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Claude Code (Anthropic) | Planning, implementation, code review, and documentation |
| GitHub Copilot | Inline code completion |

### Context Given to CC

These documents were authored by the user before implementation began and given to CC at the start of every session as the source of truth. CC was not allowed to invent behaviour that contradicted them.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) | What is in scope, deferred, and why — governs every feature decision |
| [api-contract.md](.claude/docs/api-contract.md) | Exact request/response shapes, status codes, and error messages |
| [domain-model.md](.claude/docs/domain-model.md) | Canonical domain entities and field types |
| [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) | Layer rules, architectural patterns, and Kotlin conventions |
| [write-tests.md](.claude/commands/write-tests.md) | User-authored slash command — enforces test-layer order before every feature |
| [TODO.md](.claude/TODO.md) | Ordered task list — each task handed to CC in plan mode, one at a time |

---

## How CC Was Used

Each feature was driven from `TODO.md`: the next unchecked task was given to CC in **plan mode**, CC produced a step-by-step implementation plan, and the user reviewed and gave corrections before any code was written. Once the plan was approved, CC switched to **edit/accept mode** to implement; output was reviewed before committing.

Before writing any test or feature code, CC was given the `/write-tests` command (user-authored) which enforces the test-layer order — integration test first (`@Disabled`), then repository → use case → enable. This kept every feature developed outside-in.

`CLAUDE.md` was maintained throughout: whenever CC produced output that violated a design rule, the correction was written into `CLAUDE.md` or `write-tests.md` so the same mistake could not recur in future sessions.

---

## Where User Input Directed CC

Cases where CC's output was incorrect or off-design and was corrected:

- CC placed JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`) in the domain layer — corrected to pure Kotlin data classes; JPA entities moved to `repository/`; layer rule added to `CLAUDE.md`
- CC imported the `Relationship` enum from domain into `EnrollmentRequest` (controller importing domain) — corrected to use `String` in the request; controller performs the mapping
- CC scaffolded a service interface + implementation pattern — corrected to one use case class per operation with a single `execute()` method and no interface
- CC used raw strings in `EligibilityException` — corrected to a `EligibilityReason` enum so tests assert typed reasons rather than brittle string matches
- CC searched for `@DataJpaTest` (does not exist in Spring Boot 4.x) — corrected to `@SpringBootTest` + `@Transactional`; confirmed via online search; rule added to `CLAUDE.md` and `write-tests.md`
- CC applied `@MockitoBean` to internal Spring beans in integration tests — corrected to mock only external client interfaces (`IcaClient`, `IroasClient`, `DisbursementClient`); everything inside the project boundary runs for real
- CC hardcoded `api.key=change-me` in `application.properties` — corrected to `api.key=${API_KEY}` with no fallback so startup fails without the env var
- CC split controller tests by concern (separate files for auth, audit, happy-path) — corrected to split strictly by API endpoint so all scenarios for one endpoint live in one file
- CC used comment banners for test grouping — corrected to JUnit 5 `@Nested` classes so grouping is structural
- CC proposed `IneligibleRequest` / `AlreadyIneligibleException` as names — corrected to `MarkIneligibleEnrollmentStatusRequest` / `EnrollmentAlreadyIneligibleException` with domain context in the name
- User directed method ordering convention: business logic in call order near the top, audit one-liners at the bottom; rule captured in `CLAUDE.md`
- User directed moving audit calls inside the method that owns the operation (e.g. `auditDisbursementInitiated` inside `initiateDisbursement`) so each method is self-contained

## Where CC Output Was Used After Review

Cases where CC's output was accepted after verifying it was correct:

- `Nric` as `@JvmInline value class` with masked `toString()` — CC proposed; accepted because the type system makes raw NRIC leaks impossible at compile time with no runtime overhead
- `Clock` injected as a constructor parameter into `EnrollChildUseCase` — CC proposed; accepted as it allows unit tests to control time with `Clock.fixed(...)` without Spring context
- `AuditLogger` as a pure utility (`info/warn/error` methods, no domain imports), with domain-aware audit methods as private methods in each use case — accepted after discussion; keeps the logger free of domain knowledge while keeping audit semantics close to the business logic
- MDC `caller` set in `ApiKeyFilter` after successful authentication, cleared in `finally` — accepted; every downstream log line records caller identity without threading it through the call stack
- `BaseControllerTest` with shared `@SpringBootTest`/`@AutoConfigureMockMvc` setup, `@MockitoBean` declarations, and stub helpers (`stubChildInIca`, `stubParentInIroas`, `stubDisbursement`, `stubEligibleEnrollment`) — CC implemented after user directed the extraction; reviewed and accepted
- `GlobalExceptionHandler` mapping all exception types to the correct status codes and error shapes — CC implemented; reviewed against `api-contract.md` to verify each mapping
- Dockerfile multi-stage build (dependency layer, compile layer, JRE-only runtime image) — CC drafted; verified end-to-end with `docker build` and a live smoke test confirming auth and routing work inside the container
